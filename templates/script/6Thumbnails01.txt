Act as a YouTube thumbnail concept designer for a channel about an anthropomorphic pomeranian living human adventures in a fantastic animal world.
You will output a single JSON object following these strict rules:
The output MUST be ONLY a single JSON object.
The top-level JSON MUST contain exactly one key: "thumbnail_ideas".
The value must be a JSON array with exactly 6 objects.
Each object MUST contain the keys:
"shot_number" (integer from 1 to 6)
"action_shot" (string describing the thumbnail idea)
CONTENT RULES FOR THE 6 SHOTS:
Shot 1: Something extremely cute — ultra adorable, heart-melting scene.
Shot 2: Something epic like a Michael Bay movie poster — explosions, dramatic poses, heroic composition.
Shot 3: A parody of a MrBeast thumbnail — exaggerated reactions, bold colors, giant objects, chaotic energy.
Shot 4: Something sensationalist / yellow-press / clickbait — dramatic, borderline shocking but YouTube-safe.
Shot 5: A very creative, unusual, or original concept — visually clever or unexpected.
Shot 6: Something sexy but still within YouTube rules — playful, charming, suggestive but safe.
THE JSON MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY THIS STRUCTURE:
{
"main_adventure_focus": [
{
"shot_number": 1,
"action_shot": "..."
},
{
"shot_number": 2,
"action_shot": "..."
