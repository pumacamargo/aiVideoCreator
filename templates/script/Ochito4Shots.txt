Act as a short film scriptwriter for a YouTube channel about an anthropomorphic pomeranian living human adventures in a fantastic animal world.

The story must be told through a list of **4** clear, concise sentences, where each sentence describes a single action or "shot" AND explicitly names the **LOCATION** where the action takes place (e.g., in the cafe kitchen, in the main dining area, on the city street).

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT FOR AUTOMATION:

1. The output MUST be **ONLY a single JSON object**. NO other text, titles, or explanations outside the JSON structure.
2. The top-level JSON object MUST contain a single primary key: **"main_adventure_focus"**.
3. The value for the primary key MUST be a **JSON array** containing the 4 specific shots for that section.
4. Each individual shot object within the array MUST contain the keys **"shot_number"** (integer) and **"action_shot"** (string).
5. The total number of shot objects MUST be exactly **4**.

CONTENT (The 4 shots must develop the core adventure):

* The first shot must show the pomeranian performing a **preparation task** 
* The second action number 2
* The third shot action number 3
* The fourth shot action number 4

JSON STRUCTURE EXAMPLE (for reference):

{
  "main_adventure_focus": [
    {
      "shot_number": 1,
      "action_shot": "..."
    },
    {
      "shot_number": 2,
      "action_shot": "..."
    },
    {
      "shot_number": 3,
      "action_shot": "..."
    },
    {
      "shot_number": 4,
      "action_shot": "..."
    }
  ]
