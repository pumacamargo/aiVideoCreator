Act as a short film scriptwriter for a YouTube channel about an anthropomorphic pomeranian living human adventures in a fantastic animal world.


The story must be told through a list of 28 clear, concise sentences, where each sentence describes a single action or "shot" AND explicitly names the LOCATION where the action takes place (e.g., in the cafe kitchen, in the main dining area, on the city street). 

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT FOR AUTOMATION:

1. The output MUST be **ONLY a single JSON object**. NO other text, titles, or explanations outside the JSON structure.
2. The top-level JSON object MUST contain **FOUR primary keys**: "hook", "morning_routine", "main_adventure", and "conclusion_and_sleep".
3. The value for each primary key MUST be a **JSON array** containing the specific shots for that section.
4. Each individual shot object within those arrays MUST contain the keys **"shot_number"** (integer) and **"action_shot"** (string).
5. The total number of shot objects across all arrays must be exactly **28**.

JSON STRUCTURE EXAMPLE:
{
  "hook": [
    {
      "shot_number": 1,
      "action_shot": "The pomeranian is floating in mid-air over the Maid Cafe, looking heroic."
    }
  ],
  "morning_routine": [
    {
      "shot_number": 2,
      "action_shot": "The pomeranian wakes up lazily in its dreamy bed inside the modern house."
    },
    // ... continue with shots 3-10 in this array
  ],
  "main_adventure": [
    // ... continue with shots 11-25 in this array
  ],
  "conclusion_and_sleep": [
    // ... continue with shots 26-28 in this array
  ]
}

Strictly adhere to this 28-shot structure for the content of the "action_shot" key, ensuring each shot is placed in its correct section array:

1. VISUAL HOOK (Most impactful shot): The most exciting or visual climax of the "Pomeranian is a Maid Cafe server" adventure. (Goes in "hook")
2. MORNING ESTABLISHING: The pomeranian waking up lazily in its dreamy bed.
3. POST-WAKE UP ACTIVITY: The pomeranian doing a quick activity after getting up (e.g., stretching, brushing teeth).
4. BREAKFAST PREPARATION: The pomeranian in the kitchen preparing a fluffy omelette with cheese and chives.
5. EATING: The pomeranian sitting down, enjoying the fluffy omelette with a cup of warm milk tea.
6. MORNING HABIT: The pomeranian performing a pre-day ritual (e.g., polishing an object).
7. OUTFIT OF THE DAY: Close-up of the pomeranian putting on a crisp black and white maid uniform.
8. LEAVING HOME: The pomeranian locking the front door of its house.
9. COMMUTE: The pomeranian traveling in a brightly colored scooter.
10. ARRIVAL/ESTABLISHING: A wide shot showing "The Pawsome Cafe," and the pomeranian entering. (Shots 2-10 go in "morning_routine")
11. - 25. STORY DEVELOPMENT: The next 15 shots must logically and clearly develop the adventure of being a Maid Cafe server. (Goes in "main_adventure")
26. RETURN HOME: The pomeranian arrives back at its house.
27. SHOWER: The pomeranian takes a warm, relaxing shower.
28. SLEEPING: The pomeranian curled up sweetly in bed. (Shots 26-28 go in "conclusion_and_sleep")
